<p>We may use cookies, pixel tags, Local Storage Objects, and similar technologies to automatically collect this information.

Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash Cookies”) are similar to standard cookies except that they can be larger and are downloaded to a computer or mobile device by the Adobe Flash media player.  By using the Services, you consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information we obtain from other sources</span></em>. We may receive information about you from other sources, including through third-party services and organizations.  For example, if you access third-party services, such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter, through the Services to login to the Services or to share information about your experience on the Services with others, we may collect information from these third-party services.</p>

<p>If you choose to engage in public activities on the Site, you should be aware that any information you share there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these areas.  You should use caution in disclosing personal information while participating in these areas. We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these public areas.</p>
<p><strong>IV.   </strong><strong>SECURITY </strong></p>
<p>We use reasonable measures to help protect information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

<p><strong>V.    </strong><strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong></p>

By using the Services and providing us with information, you understand and agree that your information may be transferred to and stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction and, to the extent you are a resident of a country other than the United States, that you consent to the transfer of such data to the United States for processing by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>VIII.         </strong><strong>CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we update the Privacy Policy, we will revise the “Effective Date” date above and post the new Privacy Policy.  We recommend that you review the Privacy Policy each time you visit the Services to stay informed of our privacy practices.</p>
